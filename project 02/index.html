Assignment Title: Mouse-Responsive Hover Animation

Objective:
This assignment will help you understand how to work with mouse events and basic animations using JavaScript and CSS. You will create an interactive box that responds to mouse hover by moving slightly in the direction of the cursor.

Instructions:
Create a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Place a single box (div element) in the center of the page.
When the user hovers over the box, it should slightly move or shift in the direction of the mouse cursor’s position (top, bottom, left, right).
The movement should feel responsive and smooth — use transition or transform properties for a better effect.
When the mouse leaves the box, it should return to its original position.
You are encouraged to keep the layout centered and clean.
