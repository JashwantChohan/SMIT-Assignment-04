Assignment Title: Interactive Color Picker Boxes

Objective
The goal of this assignment is to practice DOM manipulation and styling using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You will build a simple web page with multiple color boxes. When a user clicks on any color box, the background color of the entire page should change to that color.

Instructions:
Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for this task.
Create a web page that displays multiple colored boxes (at least 6 different colors).
Each box should have a fixed size (e.g., 100px by 100px) and a distinct background color.
When a user clicks on a box, the background color of the entire web page should change to match the clicked box.
Add hover effects to the boxes using CSS for better user experience.
Make sure your code is clean, well-indented, and includes comments where necessary. -->

PROJECT 02

Assignment Title: Mouse-Responsive Hover Animation

Objective:
This assignment will help you understand how to work with mouse events and basic animations using JavaScript and CSS. You will create an interactive box that responds to mouse hover by moving slightly in the direction of the cursor.

Instructions:
Create a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Place a single box (div element) in the center of the page.
When the user hovers over the box, it should slightly move or shift in the direction of the mouse cursor’s position (top, bottom, left, right).
The movement should feel responsive and smooth — use transition or transform properties for a better effect.
When the mouse leaves the box, it should return to its original position.
You are encouraged to keep the layout centered and clean.
